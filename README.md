## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed to give the user the feeling of Adventure,comfort, style and luxury. The imagery gives the customer a great understanding of what is on offer and really has an inviting presence.

### Colour
For my color theme I didn't want to pack the web page with too many deep colors which in my view would make it look less profesional, so I stuck to a greenish type of theme which gives the feel of wilderness but calmness aswell. I got my color choice from Color Hunt.

### Fonts
The fonts I used were Roboto Condensed for the body and "Roboto Slab" for headings. I used Google fonts to extract both.

### Stucture
the is nothing out of the usual with my website. it carries the basic nav bar and logo, the home image is beautiful and sleek and adds great to the look as do all the other pictures and sections. My website consists of 5 pages all with a unique layout.

- Home page has the nav and logo then the main heading and picture, Suite,Activities and our story sections which have buttons which lead to each respective page and under that we have the footer which is present and stagnant in all pages.
